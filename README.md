## Kate McAwesome

My friend Kate has a zillion websites (okay two) where she just wants a
static placeholder page. I offered to create this page for her to get
experience in simple web development for my Code Louisville portfolio.

* Responsive
* Basic accessibility
* Mobile friendly
* Uses flexbox
* Very simple graphic design
